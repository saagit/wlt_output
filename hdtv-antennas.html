<p>In order to assist translator system viewers in pulling in the best
possible signal, what follows a list of tips for installing an antenna
or &ldquo;tuning up&rdquo; an existing antenna.</p>
<h3 id="indoor-antennas">Indoor Antennas</h3>
<p>In most cases, a simple indoor, top-of-set receiving antenna should be
adequate to pull in enough signal to provide satisfactory operation.
Such antennas are neither expensive nor are they difficult to install.</p>
<p>Indoor antennas come in a variety of sizes and shapes, from the familiar
&ldquo;rabbit ears with a loop&rdquo; to futuristic panel antennas that look more
like a radar array than a set-top antenna.</p>
<h4 id="examples-of-indoor-antennas">Examples of Indoor Antennas</h4>
<p><img alt="Rabbit Ears with a Loop" src="https://westlanetv.org/images/antenna3.png">
<img alt="Modern Log-Periodic look-alike" src="https://westlanetv.org/images/antenna6.png"><br>
<img alt="Dual Loop Antenna" src="https://westlanetv.org/images/antenna5.png">
<img alt="Radar Array" src="https://westlanetv.org/images/antenna4.png"></p>
<p>Your antenna choice may come down to a matter of interior decor rather
than antenna performance if you have enough signal strength.</p>
<p>Be sure that any indoor antenna you use or purchase has a built-in UHF
&ldquo;loop&rdquo; antenna. The telescoping rod type antennas are meant for VHF
reception only, and will be of no benefit in receiving WLT translator
signals.</p>
<p>Many indoor antennas are available with a built-in preamplifier to boost
weak signals. While a preamp may improve your reception, it is also
possible that it may degrade antenna performance. As a rule, try to
select an antenna which will supply your receiver with an adequate
signal without the use of an amplifier. If using an amplifier gives you
good results, that&rsquo;s fine, but usually, if you don&rsquo;t have enough signal
to make an indoor antenna work, you should then step up to an outdoor
antenna.</p>
<h3 id="outdoor-antennas">Outdoor Antennas</h3>
<p>If you live on the fringes of the signal area, or have obstructions such
as trees, hills, or buildings between your antenna and the WLT
transmitter site on Glenada Hill south of town, you may benefit from the
use of a high-gain outdoor antenna. The following section will assist
you in choosing and installing an outdoor antenna:</p>
<p>Make sure you have the right antenna. All of our translators operate on
the UHF portion of the band, so that is the correct type of antenna to
choose. The older types of UHF antennas that were designed for channels
70 to 83 do not work well on channels 14 through 60, which is the
portion of the band we are interested in receiving.  The &ldquo;bowtie&rdquo; type
antenna is a favorite and performs very well on UHF channels. There are
other types that work quite well also.</p>
<h4 id="examples-of-outdoor-uhf-antennas">Examples of Outdoor UHF Antennas</h4>
<p><img alt="Log Periodic Antenna" src="https://westlanetv.org/images/antenna2.png">
<img alt="Bowtie Antenna" src="https://westlanetv.org/images/antenna1a.png"></p>
<p>Bowtie antennas should be aimed with the &ldquo;bowties&rdquo; facing the translator
tower.</p>
<p>Install your antenna &ldquo;in the clear&rdquo; above trees, buildings, or other
obstructions (if possible). Be sure it is in a safe area, away from any
and all power lines. If this results in a down-lead (the wire from the
antenna to the TV set) that is over about 50 feet long, consider
installing a UHF preamplifier or &ldquo;booster&rdquo;. With a good preamp you can
use enough down-lead cable to position your antenna at the most ideal
location.</p>
<p>Have someone move your antenna vertically, either up or down on its
mount while you watch your set.  Switch among the various channels with
the antenna at different heights instead of viewing just one channel.
Locate the antenna position which results in the best overall reception
on all the channels. This may be necessary even if you have a clear
unobstructed view of the translator tower. Signal reflections from the
ground in front of your receiving antenna or other nearby objects such
as buildings usually cause &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; and &ldquo;cold spots&rdquo;. Moving your
antenna, especially moving it vertically, even a foot or two can have a
dramatic effect on signal strength.</p>
<h3 id="antenna-cables">Antenna Cables</h3>
<p><img alt="Coax with F Connector" src="https://westlanetv.org/images/coax_f_connector.png">
<img alt="Twin Lead Cable" src="https://westlanetv.org/images/twin_lead.png"></p>
<p>If your down-lead is of the twin-lead type (a brown or black colored
cable with two wires embedded along the edges), replace it with
coax. You will encounter too many problems dealing with this type of
antenna lead-in wire than is worth the effort to keep it.</p>
<p>In many ways, a coaxial cable (type RG-6 is best) down-lead is easier to
install as it can be run in any manner whatsoever. The wave or
television signal energy is totally contained inside the cable and the
only way to hamper or degrade the signal it is carrying to your TV set
is to squash the whole cable.  However, matching transformers may be
needed at the antenna to go from the two screw terminals to the coaxial
cable &ldquo;type F&rdquo; connector. These matching transformers must be capable of
operating efficiently at UHF frequencies and must be weatherproof
types. Ask your dealer for the proper ones.</p>
<p>Most TV sets made nowadays have the coaxial type F connector for input,
so these sets are ready for the coaxial down-lead cable. The type F
connectors can be tricky to put on the cable for those not used to
them. A TV shop can put them on for you if you have trouble.</p>
<p>Each of West Lane Translator&rsquo;s UHF HDTV translators operates at an
effective radiated power of 2,500 watts. The transmitting equipment is
only half of the total system, however. The other half is your receiving
equipment which, like the translator, it must be kept in top condition
if the maximum potential of the system is to be realized.</p>

your needs.</p>
